# CSS Grid Reference
CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system

```
display
Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.

Values:

grid â€“ generates a block-level grid
inline-grid â€“ generates an inline-level grid
```


* grid-template-columns
* grid-template-rows
```
.container {
  grid-template-columns:  ... |   ...;
  grid-template-rows:  ... |   ...;
}
```



# Responsive design with CSS Grid

In the same way that flexbox gave us a way to layout block elements next to each other, CSS grid lets us not only arrange elements in a row or a column, but in multiple rows and columns. Finally two dimensional layouts are becoming **simpler**!
