# reading 6:Node.js
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

Google Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript Engine

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi

However, when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we donâ€™t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They arenâ€™t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating systemâ€“related utility methods.

This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, itâ€™s a JavaScript runtime.

You must Install Node.js

## Node Binaries vs Version Manager

Version Manager is a program that allows you to install multiple versions of Node and switch between them at will. There are various advantages to using a version manager. For example, it negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and lets you set a Node version on a per-project basis.
